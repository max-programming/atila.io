      Starting off as a self-taught developer made me value the community a lot.
      Sharing knowledge in conferences and meeting different people with similar
      interests is one of my biggest passions in this carreers. Therefore, I
      participate in conferences, podcasts, workshops, and meetups as often as I
      can.
